# **About Me**

Hi, I am **Nimish** :wave:,<br>

I am interested in developing my skillset in *firmware* and *specialized hardware for ML/AI* . I am looking for opportunities to apply my past experiences and develop ideas into products. 
I like to solve problems, in engineering and in life. I am a curious person, and I like to learn new things.

I am currently working on Multi-Agent RL human robot simulations as an engineering research intern at Cornell Tech in NYC. This involves designing and implementing MARL algorithms and expanding backend to process multiple tasks on multiple patients simultaneously.

During the academic semester, I build an awesome EV that competes in the annual Shell Eco Marathon. 
On other days, I am a __*TA for Digital Logic course*__. 
These are some of the best learning experiences I have had, where I have met many inspiring engineers. 


### **Technical Skills**
* Python, OCaml, C/C++, Verilog.
* experience working with Raspberry Pi, Pi Pico and ESP32-based microcontrollers (SPI, UART, CAN, BLE)
* familiarity with PCB design (Altium) and debugging hardware 
* git/ github (used for most projects as well as research)
* exploring robotics (ROS) and financial analytics during the upcoming year

In addition to these, I have _led several technical and non-technical teams with over 30 contributors_ . I like thinking about long-term, big-picture ideas to improve products and make inter-team organization/ comms smoother.

### **Misc...**

In my spare time, you will find me following up on global affairs, financial markets, and reading cool wikipedia pages. I also like to watch action movies and soccer.

I was brought up in India, and have been studying in the USA for over 4 years. The essence of a rather complex story is that I got a scholarship to complete my last two years at UWC-USA, which was a transformative opportunity to learn amongst a global community of peers. It transformed the way I look at work and life, and introduced me with a unique combination of driven and nice people.
