# **About Me**

Hi, I am **Nimish** :wave:,<br>

I am interested in developing my skillset in robotics, ML, firmware and computer hardware. I plan to enter industry upon graduation. 

I am currently working on Multi-Agent RL human robot collaboration algorithms as a engineering research intern at Cornell Tech, NYC. 

During the semester, I build an awesome EV that competes in the annual Shell Eco Marathon. On other days, I work as a course TA for a Digital Logic course. These are some of the best learning experiences I have had at Cornell, giving me an opportunity to meet many inspiring engineers. 

In my spare time, you will find me following up on global affairs, financial markets, and reading cool wikipedia pages. Sometimes, I watch movies and soccer. Lets chat about any of these. 

I was brought up in India, but have been studying in the USA for over 4 years and often visit my parents, who now live in Dubai. 

This is where can read a little more about <mark> me </mark>. **I am definitely a very interesting person with a quintillion interests**.
Or I could show off some Skills and write a bit more about things that make me more employable, like *leadership* and *teamwork*
