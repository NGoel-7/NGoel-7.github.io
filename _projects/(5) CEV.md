description: Researched feasibility of concept, prototyped from scratch and integrated car-mounted sensors such as  Rotary encoder for steering, RPM, IMU, etc. Involved usage of CAN, UART, SPI protocols for testing different set-ups. I also implemented multi-threading on a Pi Pico. Currrently working on scaling up to atleast 15 sensors for accurate and low-latency data collection. <br> 
 I was leading a team of two peers while developing this system and liasing with other vehicle sub-systems to ensure proper specifications and meeting competition requirements.
