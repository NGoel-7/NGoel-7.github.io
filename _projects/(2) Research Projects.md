# Research Projects

## AirLab: Summer Intern 
I am working on expanding an EPyMARL based hospital ER simulator for developing benchmarks for multiple robots to simultaneously execute tasks on multiple patients. It involves working on the backend consisting of the step, reward, and algorithmic design. The goal is to develop algorithms which can allow for Healthcare worker and robot interactions. By the end of the internship, I aim to run tests on this simulator using IPPO and QMIX variants. 
Over the course of this project, I have gained familiarity with RL frameworks and robot design processes. I hope to delve further into this area during my studies at Cornell and subsequent industry roles. 

## Computer Systems Lab (Prof. Zhang) 
Worked with a team of graduate students to set up AWS and generate kernels to optimize Llama 3.2 running on Tranium 2, for the ASPLOS 2025 conference.
